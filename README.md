# Geomapping-Multi-Project
An application that models terrain as a multivariable function plotted on a contour map, and then draws rivers flowing from peaks to valleys based on steepest descent. Also contains a strike + dip function that takes in an input of three points and calculates the strike and dip of a bedding plane passing through those points.
